# Final Capstone Project - OnTap
​
This directory contains the *final capstone project* from my bootcamp with Tech Elevator. 

It is a brewery finder application developed by a team of six students over two weeks utilizing an agile development process. 

**Languages and Frameworks:** Vue.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL

**Description:** Full-stack application that allows users to register, view information about local breweries and beers on tap, and review and rate beers. Brewers are able to update information about their brewery and beers on tap, and can review ratings and reviews of their beers. 

**My contributions:** Created user interface wireframes, helped craft and style the single-page application utilizing Vue’s component and view routing paradigm, built server-side RESTful API endpoints and DAO's via Spring Boot, and designed the PostgreSQL relational database for storage and retrieval of data.
